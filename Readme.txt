<++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++>

<===========TO RUN THE LINKED LIST=========================>
- Large data so have to be patience when loading program
- It can be accessed inside the folder linked_list_updated.
- Code was done using VISUAL STUDIO 2022, so there are project files with the extensions ".sln" and ".vcxproj".
- Within the linked_list_updated folder, there is a Release folder which contains the build of the project. 
  The program can be run with the application named linked list.

<===========TO RUN THE BINARY SEARCH TREE===================>
- Code inside binary_student
- Code was done using CODE BLOCKS as a primary IDE.
- Building and running the .cpp file works.
- A single large code file.

<====================HOW TO CHANGE THE DATA SETS===========>
- In any folder containing faker.py, locate the line:
  (inside the def main(): line 86)
  num_students = *any number of data*
- Then copy the students.txt file to the location where your linked list or BST is and run the program.

<NOTES>

- Separate implementation of the Faker for each BST and linked list due to slight changes in the User interface and data breakdown.
- In linked list, first and last names are separated, whereas in BST, they are in the same field.
